Here I made lots of comments in java code to explain what I am doing. First watch a video about linked list gather some idea, then see this to gain more knowledge

Let me tell you something, this is not a code of the Node (watch a video about linked list gather some idea to know what I am talking about), it's just the linked list class code, and I 
guess you can create node class if you know linked list. 

This  is just to simplify things what actually is goin on.
